# cg-tank-wars-3d

This is a remake of Kenneth Morse's Tank Wars game. It was presented as my Final Project for the Computer Graphics course at Unifesp - Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo, on 29 June 2018.

The game was written in C++ and used OpenGL for the 3D graphics.

To this date, the game is incomplete; it is only possible to play a single round.
