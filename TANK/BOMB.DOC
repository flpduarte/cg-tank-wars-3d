               -----------------------------------------------

     NOTE: This game requires a VGA or MCGA video system to
     operate.  Your computer must be capable of 320x200
     resolution with 256 simultaneous colors.
     If you do not wish to read the entire manual (and who
     does) please at least read Quick Start section.  While
     in BombCFG you may at any time press F1 to obtain case
     sensitive help.


QUICK START:  The problem with most program instructions is that
     you can't truly envision what they're talking about until
     you've played the game.  I occasionally have to play the
     game once or twice before I can understand the
     documentation.  So now I suggest that you play this game
     once or twice before reading the rest of this document.  To
     do so, follow these simple instructions:

     Load the Configuration program BOMBCFG.  Click on the OK
          button to remove the About Box.  BOMBCFG will then
          inform you that no valid configuration file was found.
          Select OK to clear this box.  Select Setup|Restore
          Defaults to reset all settings to their defaults.
          Then select Done|Save & Exit.

     Now load Tank Wars by typing "BOMB /NEW".  This will load
          Tank Wars, bypassing the Main Menu and player
          selection, and bring you right to the game.  It will
          also disable some of the more complicated options, set
          the wind speed to Low, select the easiest opponent, and
          set the number of games to five.

     To play, use Cursor Right/Left to aim your turret, and
          Cursor Up/Down to increase/decrease firing power.  The
          object is of course to eliminate your opponent.  When
          you do so (or when he eliminates you) you will see a
          status screen.  If you have accumulated enough points
          you will then be brought to a weapons purchasing
          screen.  For now, just click on Done or press 'D' to
          proceed to the next round.

MAIN MENU:  Now that you have some idea of the basics, I will go
     into more detail.  The main menu has numerous options that
     determine the play of the game.  You can use the mouse or
     keyboard to change the options.  Pressing up or down moves
     the cursor from option to option.  Pressing cursor right or
     left changes the setting for that option.  When using a
     mouse just click with the right or left button on the option
     you wish to change.
     SOUND OPTIONS:

     Sound Effects:  (Default Yes) Turns sound on or off.  Sound
          adds to the overall effect of the game, but there may
          be times when you don't want it.

     Fly Sound Effects:  (Default No) In the very first version
          of this program, each weapon would make a screeching
          sound while flying through the air.  However, after
          playing two or three times this gets extremely
          annoying, thus the creation of this option.

     GAME OPTIONS:

     Crumbling Hills:  (Default 50%) The major flaw in most games
          like this is that you can blow the ground out from
          under somebody and he'll hover there like Road-Runner
          in a cartoon.  This variable can be set between 0% and
          100%, and controls how often loose ground will fall.
          At 100% all loose ground will crumble after every shot.
          At 0%, the ground never falls, as in most cartoons.

     Walls:  (Default Random) This allows you to change the
          effect the border around the screen has on the current
          shot.  There are six settings for this option:

          Non Existent - When this option is selected any
               projectile or laser will leave the screen when it
               reaches the border.  If the wind level or gravity
               deems it should return to the screen, it will.  If
               there is absolutely no chance of returning the
               shot will abort then and there.   [Previously NOT
               BOUNCY in <2.5]

          Sticky - When this option is selected any projectile or
               laser will bounce off of the four border walls
               back into the playing field.  Any material weapon
               (ie, not a laser) will loose 50% of its velocity
               during the bounce.

          Elastic - When this option is selected any projectile
               or laser will bounce off of the four border walls
               back into the playing field with no loss of
               velocity.  Computers tend to shoot more wildly
               when this option is on.  They know that no matter
               what happens, they're going to hit something.
               [Previously BOUNCY]

          Accelerating - When this option is selected any
               projectile or laser will bounce off of the four
               border walls back into the playing field with an
               increase in velocity.  (Anybody out there remember
               flubber? If so then you've got the idea.)

          WARNING: If a projectile reaches too great a speed air
               friction will become high enough to detonate it in
               midair.

          Warping - When this option is selected the top and
               bottom walls will act exactly as if Non Existent,
               but the projection will wrap around from left to
               right (or right to left).

          Random - When this option is selected the form of wall
               will be randomly determined each round. The kind
               of wall you are dealing with will be written down
               the left side of the playing field.

     Shot Visible:  (Default Yes) When turned off, your shot is
          invisible while in the air.  This can speed up the
          game, but not by much.  Its main purpose is confusion
          and it works quite well, especially with rebounding
          walls because you never know just how many times the
          shot bounced before it landed.  Invisible shots just
          make the game more interesting.

     Trail Visible:  (Default Yes) When on, your shot will leave
     a trail while flying through the air.  It can make it easier
     to determine what adjustments are needed to hit your enemy.
     It also helps you determine whether you are in danger of
     being hit by your enemy.

     Background:  (Default Random) There are several backgrounds
          in front of which the game can take place.  These are
          each labeled with their own name.  There is also a RND
          setting which will include all backgrounds, and a USER
          setting which will include only preselected backgrounds
          (See the online help in BOMBCFG).  Backgrounds can hide
          tanks and make CRI's look extremely impressive.

     Games:  (Default 10) This determines how many rounds will be
          played before the game ends.  In a short game your main
          objective is just to destroy as fast as possible.  In a
          long game you want to rack up points so that you can
          buy weapons that help you destroy.

     Tanks Fall:  (Default Yes) This determines whether tanks
          fall when the ground is blown out from under them.
          When set to No, tanks just hover there.  When set to
          Yes, they fall and sustain damage.

     Number of Players:  (Default 2) Here you select how many
          tanks will play.  This includes computer intelligences.
          From two to ten tanks can participate.  Remember, the
          more tanks present, the closer they are together, and
          the better the chances that you'll get blown away
          before getting a shot off.

     Computers Can Buy:  (Default Yes) This allows the computer
          intelligences to buy weapons to enhance their arsenals.
          It is recommended that beginners set this to NO.

     Palette Speed:  (Default 0) This controls the speed at which
          the background moves (0 is fastest).  If the usage  of
          this effect slows down your game too much set this
          number to a higher value.

     Wind Force:  (Default Normal) This controls the speed of the
          wind during the game.  There are 5 settings ranging
          from None to Gale.  Also available is a RND which will
          cause Tank Wars to select a different wind setting each
          round.

     Team Play:  (Default Off) This enables Team Play mode, in
          which multiple players are allowed to fight together.
          Computers on the same team will not shoot at each
          other, and you are penalized for killing a teammate.

     Start:  This starts the game, bringing you to the player
          selection screen.

     PLAYER SELECTION:  Here is where you select who plays.  For
          each player playing you will be asked what will be
          controlling him.  Press 'K' for Keyboard, 'M' for Mouse
          or 'C' for computer, or simply click on the appropriate
          word.  Pressing Space or clicking on the name window
          will prompt you for the player's name.  If you selected
          'M' or 'K' you will then be asked to enter your name.
          If you selected 'C' you will then be asked which of the
          available computers you wish to play against.  The
          available computers are as follows.

          Mr.  Stupid - No Threat.
          Lobber - A threat if rebound is off.
          Rifleman - A threat if below you.
          Windless Wit - A threat if there is little wind.
          Lob & Shoot - Almost always a threat.
          Twanger - Very dangerous if reflect is on, otherwise
               identical to Rifleman.
          Wind Master - Very dangerous if rebound is off.

     TEAM PLAY:  If Team Play has been turned on, you will be
          presented with the Team Play setup screen.   Each
          player will be positioned on the left side of the
          screen, and the teams will be listed across the top.
          Press cursor Right/Left to move a player from one team
          to another, or press the right/left mouse button on a
          the player you wish to move.  After this menu you will
          be given an opportunity to name each team (Teams
          consisting of all computers will name themselves).

     PLAYING THE GAME:  Now the game begins.  First the terrain
          is drawn.  Then each of your tanks will fall from the
          sky and land somewhere on the ground.  The tanks are
          placed in random order, so that no person gets the same
          position every game.  A random player is then selected
          to go first.  Each player takes his turn in order from
          left to right, until only one player, the winner,
          remains.  Then the status screen is displayed, showing
          who is currently winning, the rankings, and other
          important information.  After that, those who have
          enough points stored up will be given the option of
          buying extra weapons to supplement their arsenal.

     CONTROLS:  At the top of the screen is information critical
          in planning your attack.  Next to POWER, ANGLE, and
          DIRECTION are the current values of how hard you will
          shoot, at what elevation, and in what direction.  Next
          to MEN is the number of men you currently have in your
          tank.  Your power is limited to 100*MEN.  WIND shows
          the current direction and strength of the wind.  A
          number between 0 and 100 is typical.  Occasionally
          however there will be gusts up to 4000 mph, which can
          have an enormous impact on your shot.  Between this
          panel and the playing field is your equipment list.  It
          consists of 20 boxes.  If a box is black, fuzzy, and
          hard to see, you don't have that item.  If a box is
          white you have that item but it is not loaded.  If a
          box is red it is loaded and armed.  Mouse and Keyboard
          commands are listed below.

     Raising/Lowering Elevation:  Pressing cursor left or right
          tilts the gun left or right respectively.  Clicking the
          left/right mouse buttons on the yellow number next to
          ANGLE has the same effect.  The gun has a full 180
          degree range, and if lowered below 0 will wrap around
          and begin climbing the other side.  Remember to look at
          your cannon direction itself, just the ANGLE number can
          be deceptive.

     Raising/Lowering Power:  Pressing cursor up or down raises
          or lowers the power respectively, by increments of 1.
          Pressing PgUp and PgDn change power by increments of
          100.  Clicking the right or left mouse buttons on the
          number next to POWER has the same effect as cursor up
          or down.  Clicking on POWER has the same effect as PgUp
          and PgDn.

     Changing Direction:  If you simply wish to reverse direction
          without changing ANGLE you can simply press 'I', or
          click on the yellow arrow next to DIRECTION with the
          mouse.

     Firing:  Pressing SPACE or RETURN will fire the gun.  It can
          be fired with the mouse by pressing both buttons at the
          same time.
     Status Information:  To obtain information on any player
          press the number key corresponding to their number.
          Press '1' for player 1, '0' for player 10, etc..  With
          the mouse simply click the left button on whomever you
          wish to obtain information about.  Press any key or
          button to put away the information screen.

     Changing Weapon:  To change the active weapon, press TAB or
          SHIFT-TAB.  These keys will cycle through all the
          weapons you currently have.  Clicking right and left
          mouse buttons on the strip of weapons above the playing
          field has the same effect.  What each weapon does is
          listed later.

     Guidance Systems:  Later in the game you may acquire
          guidance systems.  To toggle a system on or off simply
          press 'H' or 'V', or click on the white 'H' or 'V',
          depending on which system you bought.  (The reason for
          choosing H and V will become apparent later.)  When
          asked what target to aim for press cursor right/left to
          rotate through the possible targets, or simply click on
          the target with the mouse.

     Keyboard Users:  If these commands change angle and power
          too fast for you, you may hold down ALT while pressing
          the appropriate key.  This will slow down the rate of
          change to one unit per keypress.

     CONTROL KEYS:  The following is a list of keys that can be
          pressed at any time during game play, (while the
          playing field is up, not during the main menu or while
          purchasing weapons).  I realize some of the key
          combinations are a tad esoteric, and I really do intend
          to do something about it.

     Sound Toggle:  Pressing CTRL-S will toggle sound on or off.

     Status:  Pressing CTRL-P will pause the game and bring up a
          status screen indicating the current game and other
          helpful information.

     Mass Kill:  Pressing CTRL-M will kill all the players on the
          screen.  Use this when a group of computers are
          involved in a fight that looks like it will go on
          forever.  All players will die after the current
          player's turn is over.  However, if the computer feels
          a game is dragging on, it will start taking pot shots
          at tanks with lightning bolts to end the game quicker.

     Quit:  Pressing CTRL-Q will abort the game.

     Palette Speed:  Pressing F3 and F4 will increase/decrease
          the speed at which the background moves.

     Change Colors:  If the background colors are not to your
          liking, press CTRL-R to get a new set.


     Boss Key:  This is the one exception to the statement made
          above.  This key, F10, will work AT ANY TIME while the
          game is running.  It will bring up a fake DOS prompt,
          which does nothing.  Pressing the space bar will return
          you to your game.  If the boss will not go away, press
          ESC.  You will be dropped into real DOS.  Tank Wars
          will remove itself from memory and attempt to save your
          game under the title 'BOSS'.

     STATUS SCREENS:  Between rounds you will be presented with
          two status screens (only one if you are not in Team
          Play).  These screens rank the players and teams
          competing, display their scores, and number of wins.
          On these screens are three buttons, OK, ADD, and SAVE.
          Pressing OK will close the current screen and go to the
          next one.  Pressing ADD allows you to add more games to
          the current battle.  Pressing SAVE will bring you to
          the save menu.  You can also click on any player or
          team name and get more in depth statistics such as
          average accuracy and kill rate.

     SAVE MENU:  After clicking on SAVE from a status screen you
          are brought to this menu.  A default game name will be
          selected for you (Such as GAME1), and you will be
          presented with five options:

          Cancel - Will exit the save menu without acting.
          New Name - Will allow you to change the name of the
               current game.
          Save - Will save the game and exit the save menu.
          Save & Quit - Will save the game and exit to DOS.
          AutoSave - This is a toggle switch.  When on, the game
               will be saved after every round under the current
               game name.

     LOAD MENU:  This menu can be accessed by clicking on the
          LOAD button available on the main menu screen.  Within
          the grey box will be the name of a saved game.  Click
          on the right or left arrows to select a different game,
          and select OK to load that game.

     BUYING EQUIPMENT:  After each round you may be brought to
          the equipment screen.  Here you are presented with a
          list of what items you can buy with your current money
          supply.  (Money is directly related to score.)  Press +
          or - on an item to increment/decrement the number you
          wish to buy.  With the mouse simply click on the item
          with the right button to select, left to deselect.
          Press 'P' or click on 'Purchase' to buy those items
          selected.  Press 'D' or click on 'Done' to buy selected
          items and exit the screen.  The list of items is
          vaguely described later.

     COMPUTERS:  There are currently 7 computers to challenge
          you.  I hope to add more, and if you have any ideas for
          other algorithms please send them to me.

          Mr.  Stupid:  A complete idiot.  He just picks a random
               power and angle, and shoots.  There's no guarantee
               that he'll even shoot in the right direction.  A
               good opponent for your first game.

          Lobber:  This computer uses fairly decent logic.  He
               shoots 2 random powered shots at 75 degrees.  The
               closest person to his second shot is then dubbed
               his target.  He calculates how much his power
               needs to be altered to hit his target.  His third
               shot usually misses, but his fourth is usually
               pretty accurate.  Strong wind (150+) can throw his
               shots off, lessening him as a threat.  Rebound
               completely confuses him.  He just can't comprehend
               why his shots aren't following nice parabolic
               paths.

          Rifleman:  This computer uses one of the simplest, and
               possibly most effective strategies.  If he's below
               you he simply points his turret at you, sets it at
               full power and fires.  If there are no targets
               above him, he'll just shoot randomly.

          Windless Wit:  This computer uses physics to hit his
               target.  However, he has not yet figured out how
               to compensate for wind.  In low wind (0-20), you
               could be in trouble.  The higher the wind, the
               longer you'll live.

          Lob & Shoot:  If there is no rebound, he fights as
               lobber.  If there is rebound he fights as
               rifleman.  This can be very effective when rebound
               is set to Random.

          Twanger:  If rebound is not on, will fight just like
               Rifleman.  However, if reflect is on he will
               attempt to bounce his shot off the ceiling and
               nail you.  This is surprisingly effective.
               (Better than I expected.)

          Wind Master:  The newest of the computer intelligences.
               He is a Windless Wit who can compensate for wind.
               When rebound is on he gets confused.  When the
               walls are non reflective, you can see some
               incredible shots.  About 90% accurate in wind up
               to 2000 mph.

          WEAPONS:  There are currently 18 weapons, 2 guidance
               systems, and 3 defenses available for purchase.
               The descriptions that follow are intentionally
               vague, it is up to you to determine what each
               group of weapons will do, and what their best use
               is.

          The first three are available when the game begins.

          Lead Ball:  Useless, completely useless (almost).  They
               do only 5 men worth of damage.  It is up to you to
               figure out the best use for these.

          Hand Grenade:  This is a wimpy little bomb.  It has a
               very small blast range.  It can only kill a tank
               if it hits it directly.

          Standard Incinerator:  These are your normal weapons.
               They have a reasonable blast radius, and can kill
               fairly easily.

          Mark II Incinerator:  Twice the size of Standard
               Incinerators.

          Nukes:  20K and 5M Nukes explode the same as
               Incinerators, but with MUCH bigger blast radii.  5
               Meg's have been known to take out up to 7 tanks in
               one explosion.

          MIRVs:  Fire one of these little beauties and it will
               split into 5 Mark II's when its arc reaches its
               peak.

          Chain Reaction Inducers (CRI's):  These start a chain
               reaction in the ground.  Depending on the strength
               of the CRI it can do little damage, or can destroy
               almost all the ground on the screen.  CRI's are
               identified with a number followed by a 'D' or
               'ND'.  The number determines how radioactive the
               reaction is.  'D's are much more 'fluent' than
               'ND's.  It's quite hard to explain, but you should
               be able to figure it out after using a few.

          Sonic Blaster:  These are only helpful in games when
               Crumble is set to a low percentage.  When these
               hit the ground they emit a high pitched sonic
               whine, causing all loose ground to collapse.
               These are especially helpful after a CRI has been
               released and there are tanks hanging in mid air on
               only a few pixels of ground.  This will take those
               precious pixels out from under them and send them
               careening to their death.

          Balls 'o' Dirt:  These are fairly self explanatory.
               When they explode, instead of a big ball of fire,
               a big ball  of dirt is created.  I'll leave it up
               to you to determine the best use for these.

          Explosive Dirt:  When this hits, it spews dirt up into
               the air.  It may just stay there, or it may fall
               back down depending on what you set crumble to.

          Lasers:  These work a little differently than the other
               weapons.  Purchasing one of these gives you 1000
               units of laser energy.  The power value you select
               is how much of this energy you wish to use.  If
               you have less than 100 units the laser cannot
               fire.

          Guidance Systems:  I'll leave it up to you to figure
               out how to use these.  They're very powerful,
               effective, and easy to misuse.

          Defense Systems:  The three defense systems are fairly
               self explanatory.  One will protect you from
               explosions, one will protect you from falling, and
               one will repel enemy fire.

     COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS:  You can override all of the
          defaults on the command line.  The format is:

     BOMB command1 command2 command3 ....etc.

     The commands are as follows:

     Game Options:
          S+|-  Sound - On or Off
          F+|-  Flysound - On or Off
          Gnn   Where nn=The Number of Games you Wish to Play

                4 - Warp
                5 - Random
          Cnnn  Crumble Percentage (0..100)
          I+|-  Invisible Ball - On or Off
          T+|-  Shot Trace - On or Off
          D+|-  Tanks Fall Down - On or Off
          B+|-  Computers Can Buy Weapons - On or Off
          TEAM  Activate Team Play Mode

     Hardware Options:
          M+|-  Enable|Disable Mouse
          DV+|- Direct Video Port Access - Active or Inactive
          CV+|- Crude Video Manipulation - Active or Inactive
          P+|-  Palette Rotation - Active or Inactive
          PV    Palette Rotation uses Video Retrace Interrupt
          PT    Palette Rotation uses Timer Interrupt

     Speed Options:
          SKIP  Skip Title Screen
          ESnn  Explosion Speed
          FSnn  Fall Speed
          PSnn  Projectile Speed
          SSnn  Shot Speed

          It is preferable to set these options in BOMBCFG, as
     they will be saved and you will not need to re-enter them
     every time you run Tank Wars.  Keep in mind that any options
     specified on the command line will override the options
     stored in BOMB.CFG.

     EXAMPLE:

     To play a 30 game set, with crumble set at 75%, random
     walls, and shot trails you would enter the  following.

     BOMB G30 C75 R5 T+

     There is no required order.  If contradictory commands are
     issued, all but the last one will be ignored.

     Users from previous versions will note changes in some
     commands.  The old version of each command still exists, for
     example 'RR' will select a random wall, and 'NOCRUDE' will
     still disable the Crude Palette Interface.

     The Speed Parameters require special explanation.  Three of
     the four, TS (Turret Speed), ES (Explosion Speed) and FS
     (Fall Speed) are microsecond delays inserted into the proper
     event.  For example, setting FS to 10 will create a ten
     microsecond delay every time a tank falls one pixel.  Turret
     Speed controls the rate at which a turret will turn.  Change
     this if the turret is moving too fast to aim accurately.
     Explosion Speed is the speed at which Explosions occur.
     Change this to fine tune the rate at which things explode,
     in case they were happening too fast to see or too slow to
     bear.  Remember that smaller numbers are faster speeds.
          Shot Speed operates uniquely.  It is not a strict
     delay, but a measure of accuracy.  The number you set here
     is used as the number of times the shot's position is
     calculated for each movement.  For example, setting this to
     20 will divide each projectile movement into twenty finer
     movements, improving the smoothness of the path.  Setting
     this to 1 will cause fewer calculations, and a jerky path,
     but faster speed.  Also with fewer calculations and higher
     powers the ball will appear to jump from place to place,
     possibly passing through tanks or past walls.  If this
     happens increase this setting to solve the problem.  This
     option is placed under speed because it has a direct effect
     on the game's speed.  The higher the number, the higher the
     accuracy, the slower the game. It is a tradeoff between
     speed and accuracy.

          If the program is detecting a mouse, when there is not
     one or is not detecting a mouse you have, use the M
     parameter.  M+ will force a mouse to be detected.  M- will
     prohibit use of the mouse.

     BOMBCFG.EXE:  New with Version 2.5 is the configuration
          program BOMBCFG.  This can be used to set the defaults
          for most of the options available.  It is a fairly
          simple program with standard drop down menus, and cases
          sensitive help.  Just press F1 at any time to bring up
          a help window for the set of options you are currently
          looking at.

     INTENDED ADDITIONS:  I've been working on this program for
          quite a while, and it is by no means complete.  I
          intend to add more weapons, and to develop more
          computer intelligences.  Also, I hope to find even more
          ways to speed up the program without sacrificing any
          graphical effects.  As noted I am working on MIDI
          support, and possibly other external sound systems.  I
          am also looking into the possibilities of a modem or
          network version of Tank Wars.
